# Configuration file for sr620.py script to communicate with SR620 universal time interval counter and reading and storing measured values.
# The configuration parameter priority is 1. command line arguments 2. yaml configuration file settings 3. default values

# ----------------------  SERIAL PORT CONNECTION  -----------------------
# Use default port settings of the SR620 counter - 9600 8N1
# IMPORTANT NOTE - the timeout must be sufficienly long to accomodate whole time of performing one measurement of N samples

serial_connection:
  device: /dev/ttyAMA0
  timeout: 2
  baudrate: 9600

# ----------------------  OUTPUTS  --------------------------------------
# You may disconnect the usb flash drive anytime configured as secondary log folder.
# Just do not forget to plug it in again.
# Data file filename are generated in the form of <prefix>YYYYDOYHHMM.txt where DOY is day of year (001-366)

# the folder must exists prior starting the script
primary_data_path: ./data/
# can be dettachable
secondary_data_path: /mnt/usb/ 

#Data file prefix.
prefix: sr620-

# Number of days after which data files will be deleted from primary_data_path
max_history: 999
# Number of days that will be sync to second data file location (e.g. usb drive) upon being available.
max_sync: 32

# ----------------------  INSTRUMENT CONFIGURATION  ---------------------
# Script logs PPS delay measurement between A-B channels with SR620.
# Defaults are A-B time interval measurement, 1.5V trigger level, DC, 50 Ohms for both channels.
